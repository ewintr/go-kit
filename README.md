# Go-Kit 

This is a collection of some small go packages that were useful enough for me to include them in more than one project. It currently contains:

* `log` - An adapter for third party logging libraries
* `slugify` - Generate url's from titles
* `smtp` - Simple wrapper around the smtp package in the standard library
* `test` - Minimalist set of functions for unit testing

Import as `import "ewintr.nl/go-kit/..."`
